# Intro To ESP32
This repository provide practical documentation using ESP32 integrated with all Sensor Module

This project allows you to practice ESP32 for all **Microcontroller**. It can be used as an alternative to `Premium Course` and offers useful features and customization using sensor.

It has been written **100% in C**. ❤️

# Protocol
IoT communication protocols are modes of communication that protect and ensure optimum security to the data being exchanged between connected devices. The IoT devices are typically connected to the Internet via an IP (Internet Protocol) network. (https://www.kelltontech.com/kellton-tech-blog/internet-of-things-protocols-standards)

## WiFi
Wi-Fi is a term for certain types of WLAN that use specifications in the 802.11 family. The term Wi-Fi was created by an organization called the Wi-Fi Alliance, which oversees tests that certify product interoperability. A wireless LAN node that provides a public Internet connection via Wi-Fi from a given location is called a hot spot. Many airports, hotels, and fast-food facilities offer public access to Wi-Fi networks. (https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/tutorial/Wireless-protocols-learning-guide)
